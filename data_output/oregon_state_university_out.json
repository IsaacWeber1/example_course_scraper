        "description": "Climate change will alter mountain snowpack, water availability, coastal storms, erosion, and sea level in the Pacific Northwest. Increasing temperatures and changing precipitation patterns will lead to more extreme drought and flooding events, wildfire seasons, and insect and disease outbreaks in forests. These changes will impact the region's natural resource economy; heritage and quality of life; water, transportation, and energy infrastructure; and health and social systems. Case studies of past extreme years highlight the close interrelationships between the climate, the natural and built environment, and the health and well-being of the Pacific Northwest’s residents.
